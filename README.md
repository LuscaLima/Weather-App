### Requirements

You can see the aplication running online, but if you want to run the app locally or make some changes, you must have the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and a code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your machine.

#### Runing the application

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone <https://github.com/LuscaLima/Weather-App.git>

# Access the project folder on terminal/cmd
$ cd weather-app

# Intall the dependencies
$ yarn

# Run the app in developer mode
$ yarn dev

# The server will start on port 3000 by default.
# Access <http://localhost:3000>
```

> PS: The application requires that you configure your own query API keys within an `.env` file. There is a `.env.example` that show you the two keys needed.
